Add life to the tank, so it now can withstand 3 bullets now

I implement the shield, when picking up the star from the ground, hero tank will be unbeatable
maybe we can change the state of the tank to indicate that it now has shield

but fails on trying to let it dash, when pushing d, it doesn't move at all, 
When pressing the D, it doesn't respond to any key except the space key, the tank stays static, 
It seems that it doesn't step into the dash() function at all.
